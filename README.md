# 🏠 Airbnb Clone Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is designed to simulate the core functionality of Airbnb while reinforcing modern software development practices. The goal is to build a scalable backend architecture, secure APIs, and an efficient deployment pipeline.

### 🎯 Project Goals
- Build a backend system that supports property rentals, bookings, and reviews.  
- Implement advanced security measures to protect user and transaction data.  
- Collaborate effectively using GitHub workflows.  
- Gain experience with CI/CD pipelines for streamlined deployment.  
- Integrate multiple technologies into a unified system.

## 👥 Team Roles
- **Backend Developer** → Implements business logic, builds REST/GraphQL APIs, and ensures performance and scalability.  
- **Database Administrator (DBA)** → Designs and optimizes the relational database schema, manages data integrity, and ensures efficient queries.  
- **DevOps Engineer** → Sets up CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and manages deployment environments.  
- **Security Engineer** → Implements authentication/authorization, secures API endpoints, and monitors vulnerabilities.  
- **Project Manager** → Coordinates the team, ensures deadlines are met, and maintains project documentation.  

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Django** → Backend framework for building APIs and handling business logic.  
- **MySQL** → Relational database for managing structured data like users, properties, and bookings.  
- **GraphQL** → Enables flexible queries and efficient data fetching for the client side.  
- **Docker** → Ensures consistent development and deployment environments.  
- **GitHub Actions** → Automates testing, linting, and deployment pipelines.

## 🗄️ Database Design

### Key Entities & Fields
1. **Users**  
   - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role` (guest/host/admin)  

2. **Properties**  
   - `id`, `title`, `location`, `price_per_night`, `owner_id`  

3. **Bookings**  
   - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`  

4. **Reviews**  
   - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`  

5. **Payments**  
   - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`  

### Relationships
- A **User** can list multiple **Properties**.  
- A **Booking** belongs to both a **User** (guest) and a **Property**.  
- A **Review** is linked to both **User** and **Property**.  
- A **Payment** is tied to a **Booking**.

## 🚀 Feature Breakdown
- **User Management** → Registration, login, and profile management for hosts and guests.  
- **Property Management** → Hosts can add, update, and delete properties with details like location, price, and availability.  
- **Booking System** → Guests can book properties, check availability, and manage reservations.  
- **Review System** → Users can leave ratings and feedback on properties they’ve booked.  
- **Payment Integration** → Secure online payments linked to bookings.  

---

## 🔒 API Security
- **Authentication** → JWT-based login ensures only valid users access protected resources.  
- **Authorization** → Role-based permissions (guest, host, admin).  
- **Data Validation** → Input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.  
- **Rate Limiting** → Prevents abuse of APIs (e.g., repeated booking requests).  
- **Encryption** → Secure storage of passwords and sensitive user/payment data.  

**Why it matters:**  
- Protects user data and transactions.  
- Ensures only authorized users perform sensitive actions.  
- Prevents malicious activity and service abuse.  

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline
- **CI (Continuous Integration)** → Automated testing, linting, and building triggered on every commit/pull request.  
- **CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery)** → Deploy updates seamlessly to staging/production environments.  

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions** → Workflow automation for tests & deployment.  
- **Docker** → Containerized app for consistency across environments.  
- **(Optional: Heroku / AWS / Render)** → Hosting and deployment.
